### Document Modification Context

All of the normal 'pre' and 'post' hook events for document modification when an advancement manager flow finishes (Actor Update, Item Creation, Item Update, and Item Deletion) have a custom flag on them: `isAdvancement`. This allows a hook listener to react differently to advancement-created hook events vs normal ones.

```js
Hooks.on('updateActor', (actor, change, options) => {
  if ( options.isAdvancement ) {
    // do something special
  }
})
```
